       <ul> <li><strong>Position</strong>: Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, making it the first planet in the Solar System.</p>
       </li>
       <li><p><strong>Size</strong>: It is the smallest planet in our Solar System, slightly larger than Earth's Moon.</p>
       </li>
            
                <p><li><strong>Orbital Period</strong>: Mercury takes about 88 Earth days to complete one orbit around the Sun.</li>
                <li><strong>Rotation</strong>: One full rotation takes about 59 Earth days.</li>
            </p>
       <li> <p><strong>Surface and Composition</strong>: Mercury’s surface is rocky and heavily cratered, similar to our Moon. It is composed mostly of a dense iron core, which makes up about 85% of the planet’s radius, giving it a high density.</p>
       </li>
       <li><p><strong>Temperature</strong>: Daytime temperatures can reach up to 430°C, while nighttime temperatures can plummet to -180°C (-290°F) due to the lack of an atmosphere to retain heat.</p>
       </li>
       <li><p><strong>Atmosphere</strong>: Mercury has a very thin atmosphere (exosphere) consisting of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium. This exosphere is not dense enough to support weather or protect the surface from solar radiation.</p>
       </li>
       <li><p><strong>Exploration</strong>: The planet has been visited by spacecraft such as <em>Mariner 10</em> and <em>MESSENGER</em>, which provided significant insights into its geology and magnetic field.</p>
       </li>
       <li><p><strong>Interesting Facts</strong>: Mercury has the most eccentric (elliptical) orbit of all the planets in our Solar System. Due to its slow rotation and fast orbit, the Sun appears to rise briefly, set, and rise again from certain points on Mercury’s surface.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Venus: The Veiled Planet</h2>
      <div style="display: flex;">
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Position</strong>: Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is Earth’s closest planetary neighbor.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Size</strong>: Venus is similar in size and structure to Earth, earning it the nickname "Earth’s twin."</p></li>
        <li><strong>Orbital Period</strong>: It takes about 225 Earth days to orbit the Sun.</li>
        <li><strong>Rotation</strong>: It rotates on its axis in the opposite direction of most planets (retrograde rotation), and a day on Venus lasts about 243 Earth days.</li></p>
        <li><p><strong>Surface and Composition</strong>: It has a rocky surface covered with vast plains, highland regions, and numerous volcanoes. The surface is hidden beneath thick clouds of sulfuric acid, making it difficult to observe directly.</li></p>
        <li><p><strong>Temperature</strong>: It is the hottest planet in our Solar System, with average surface temperatures reaching around 465°C due to its dense atmosphere and runaway greenhouse effect.</li></p>
        <li><p><strong>Atmosphere</strong>: It has an extremely thick atmosphere, composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid. This creates a crushing pressure at the surface, over 90 times that of Earth’s.</li></p>
        <li><p><strong>Exploration</strong>: It has been explored by multiple spacecraft, including NASA’s *Magellan* probe, which mapped the planet’s surface using radar. The Soviet Union's *Venera* series also provided valuable data and images of Venus’s surface.</li></p>
        <li><p><strong>Interesting Facts</strong>: It has no moons or rings, and its thick atmosphere makes it the brightest planet in our night sky, often called the "Evening Star" or "Morning Star." The surface conditions are so extreme that most spacecraft have survived only a few hours after landing.While the surface of Venus is too hostile for life as we know it, some scientists theorize that microbial life could potentially exist in the more temperate cloud layers high in its atmosphere. However, this idea is still speculative, and more research and missions to Venus would be needed to confirm any such possibility.</li></p>

                    Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, is famous for its massive size, rapid rotation, and its many moons, including Ganymede, the largest moon in the solar system.
                </li>
                <li> Jupiter's atmosphere is also home to powerful storms, including the famous Great Red Spot, a high-pressure region producing an anticyclonic storm that has persisted for centuries. This storm is so large that it could fit Earth inside it more than once. Additionally, Jupiter has other smaller, fast-moving storms and turbulent regions that continue to fascinate scientists.</li>
                <li> Jupiter also boasts a diverse array of over 79 known moons, with the four largest being the Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610, these moons are among the most fascinating objects in the solar system. For example, Europa is believed to have a subsurface ocean beneath its icy crust, raising the possibility of extraterrestrial life, while Io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system due to gravitational interactions with Jupiter.</li>
            <Li>Jupiter plays a critical role in protecting the inner solar system due to its strong gravitational field. It acts as a “cosmic vacuum cleaner,” attracting and deflecting many comets and asteroids that might otherwise impact Earth and other planets. This function highlights the importance of Jupiter not just as a subject of scientific inquiry, but as a protective force in the solar system’s dynamics.</Li>

            <p><ul style="margin: 100px;"><li>Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun in our Solar System. Known for its deep blue color, Neptune is classified as an ice giant due to its composition, which includes water, ammonia, and methane ices. With strong winds reaching up to 2,100 km/h, Neptune is the windiest planet in the Solar System.</li>
                    <li style="padding-top: 40px;">Neptune formed about 4.5 billion years ago, around the same time as the rest of the solar system. It likely formed closer to the Sun and then migrated outward to its current position</li>
